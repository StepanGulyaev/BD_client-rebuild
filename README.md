# BD_client-rebuild

That project was made on base of the someone's DB. Added a few functions (delete,update)
I also got a piece of client from another person.It was OK on the code level but there was a lot of mistakes i had to fix
So it's just me cleaning out and improving other's code. 
Tried to do it in a simplest way possible and not change original too much
A pretty good exercise tho
